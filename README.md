# Biodiversity Analysis Project

## Overview

The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of biodiversity data sourced from the National Parks Service, with a specific focus on the observation of different species across various national park locations.

## Goal

The National Park Service aims to protect endangered species and maintain biodiversity in their parks. As an analyst, your key tasks involve studying species characteristics, conservation status, and their connection to the parks.

## Objective

The project sets out to address several key questions, aiming to shed light on various aspects of biodiversity and conservation within the national parks:

- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
- Which animal is most prevalent, and what is their distribution amongst parks?

## Key Activities

The project encompasses a range of tasks, including:

- Scoping
- Data analysis
- Data preparation
- Visualization
- Interpretation of the analysis results

## Data Sources

This project has two data sets:
- `Observations.csv`: Contains information about each species and their observations in park locations.
- `Species_info.csv`: Provides details about the different species in the National Parks.

Please note that the data for this project is inspired by real data but is mostly fictional.

## Analysis

In this section, descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will also be used to test if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include:

- Distributions
- Counts
- Relationships between species
- Conservation status of species
- Observations of species in parks

## Evaluation

To revisit the goals and check if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered (in the objective section).

## Getting Started

To run the project, you will need to import some Python modules. Make sure you have the following modules installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Loading the Data

To analyze species conservation status and observations in national parks, you can load datasets into DataFrames for analysis. Read `Observations.csv` and `Species_info.csv` into DataFrames named `observations` and `species`.

## Data Characteristics

Understand the shape and characteristics of the data:

- Explore data shapes, unique species, categories, distribution of categories, and conservation status breakdown.

## Analysis and Visualization

The project involves analysis and visualization of the data. Detailed code and explanations for analysis can be found in the project files.

## Results

The analysis reveals insights about the distribution of conservation status, the likelihood of endangerment by species type, significant differences in conservation status, and the prevalence of species in different parks.

## Conclusions

This project successfully analyzed biodiversity data from National Parks and provided valuable insights into conservation status and species distribution. The findings can aid in making informed decisions about conservation efforts in these parks.

## Further Research

Future research could explore changes in conservation status over time, consider the park sizes, and examine spatial distributions of species.
